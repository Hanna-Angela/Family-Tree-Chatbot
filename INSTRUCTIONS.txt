INSTRUCTIONS: 

	- Essentially, if you want to make statements, you simply use the following statements below. Keep in mind that each statement is space-sensitive, meaning you have to follow the exact spacing conventions as the examples we've provided. For statements, you simply end with a period. If you want to ask the chatbot something, follow the examples we've provided below for questions as well. In this case, always end your questions with a question mark. When asking a question, similarly to providing a statement, the format is also space-sensitive. 

	- The program is not case-sensitive. 

LEGENDS: (\w+) or (.+?) will be the names the user will input.
